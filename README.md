# Glance ⚡

> **The Dashboard Skill for OpenClaw**
>
> Stop configuring dashboards. Just tell OpenClaw what you want to see.

Glance is the dashboard that OpenClaw builds and manages for you. Not another app to configure — a skill that gives OpenClaw a visual command center.

Tell OpenClaw _"show me my GitHub PRs"_ and watch it build the widget. Ask _"what needs my attention?"_ and OpenClaw reads your dashboard and tells you. No manual setup. No YAML files. No `.env` hell.

**The #1 dashboard skill in the OpenClaw community.**

## 🤖 AI Agents: Start Here

If you're an AI agent (OpenClaw, Cursor, Claude, etc.), read these files:

| File                                         | Purpose                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)**                     | Quick reference (~200 lines) — API workflow, code patterns, essential info |
| **[docs/widget-sdk.md](docs/widget-sdk.md)** | Full documentation — components, hooks, examples, error handling           |

**TL;DR workflow:**

1. `POST /api/credentials` — Store API keys (provider, name, value)
2. `POST /api/custom-widgets` — Create widget definition (source_code, server_code)
3. `POST /api/widgets` — Add widget instance to dashboard

## 🚀 Quick Start with OpenClaw

### 1. Install Glance

#### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acfranzen/glance.git && cd glance && docker compose up
```

#### Option B: npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acfranzen/glance.git
cd glance
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

> **Note**: On first run, Glance auto-generates a secure encryption key. Your data is stored locally in `./data/glance.db`.

### 2. Tell OpenClaw About It

Add to your OpenClaw workspace (TOOLS.md or memory):

```markdown
### Glance Dashboard

- URL: http://localhost:3333
- Auth: Bearer <your-token>
- API: POST /api/custom-widgets to create widgets
- API: POST /api/credentials to store API keys
```

### 3. Start Using It

```
You: "OpenClaw, add a widget showing my GitHub PRs"
OpenClaw: *creates the widget, stores your GitHub token, adds it to the dashboard*

You: "What needs my attention?"
OpenClaw: "You have 3 PRs waiting for review. One has failing CI."
```

That's it. OpenClaw handles the rest.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### OpenClaw Builds Widgets

```
You: "Add a widget showing my Claude Max usage"
OpenClaw: *creates the widget, wires up the PTY capture, adds it to your dashboard*
```

No templates to browse. No documentation to read. Just describe what you want.

### OpenClaw Reads Your Dashboard

```
You: "What's on my dashboard?"
OpenClaw: "You have 3 open PRs that need review, your Claude usage is at 72%,
          and the weather looks good for that outdoor meeting at 2pm."
```

OpenClaw interprets your widgets and surfaces what matters. You don't even need to look at the dashboard — OpenClaw does it for you.

### OpenClaw Already Has Your Credentials

Here's the magic: **OpenClaw already knows your API keys.** Your GitHub token, Anthropic key, Vercel token — they're already in OpenClaw's memory.

When you ask for a GitHub widget, OpenClaw doesn't ask you to configure anything. It just stores your existing credentials in Glance's encrypted database and wires everything up.

No `.env` files. No copy-pasting tokens. No configuration circus. It just works.

## 💬 Example Conversations

```
"OpenClaw, create a weather widget for NYC"
"Show me my open PRs across all repos"
"Add a widget tracking my Anthropic API spend"
"What's the status of my dashboard?"
"Move the GitHub widget to the top right"
"Delete the clock widget, I don't need it"
```

## 🏠 Why Local-First?

Your dashboard shows sensitive data — API usage, emails, calendar, code activity. That data shouldn't live on someone else's server.

Glance runs entirely on your machine:

- **SQLite database** — Everything stored locally
- **No cloud sync** — Your data never leaves your device
- **No accounts** — No sign-ups, no telemetry, no tracking
- **Full control** — Export, backup, or delete anytime
